You tie up the ship at a single, rickety dock, and Captain Yachty and you walk up to the hut. The door is open, and you peer inside and see a ladder leading to what seems to be a cave below the but. Captain Yachty asks, "What's our next move comrade?"

# down-the-ladder
Go down the ladder, and see what lies in the cave...

# wait-patiently
Like the respectful house guests that you are, wait until the owner shows up.

# diff-island
Give up in this dinky little island, and visit a different one
