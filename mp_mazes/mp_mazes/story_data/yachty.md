You awaken, lying on a creaking wooden floor that's... swaying? You are a on a boat! The harsh sun glares down on you as you get your bearings. A figure eclipses the sun and reaches out his hand:

"Ahoy shipmate! Glad to see you've woken up. I'm your captain, Lil Yachty. Now, remind me, what was our destination?"

Flustered, you scan the horizon and see three islands:

# little-island
A narrow island, spiraling upwards, and at the top, a single hut, possibly the house of a sea wayfarer?

# middle-island
A modest-sized island, with a cluster of houses. Smoke is rising from the middle of the village, suggesting a pig roast, or a bonfire.

# big-island
A towering island, with charred grass all along the surface. An enormous volcano stands in the middle, and at the lip of the volcano, a dark, foreboding temple.

# swan-dive
Panicked by the thought of making and committing to a decision, you decide to swan dive off the boat, into the water
